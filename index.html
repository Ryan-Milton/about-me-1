    <h1>About Me: Vinh Nguyen!</h1>

    <p>I am an ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING GRADUATE AND FORMER NUCLEAR SUBMARINE OFFICER, with five years of experience in the worldâ€™s
        most accomplished nuclear program seeking a challenging and rewarding career in the technology sector. An educational
        background in Electrical/Mechanical Engineering and three years of operational experience on a Nuclear Ballistic

        The multi-role nature of being a Naval Officer has allowed me to be a strong multifaceted leader able to plan and
        carry out complex, integrated projects. </p>
